#About Me

##Interests  
Hello! I'm Alyson and have been back taking classes at Wake Tech to pursue another degree after getting a bachelor's degree back in 2012. I have three little kids and a husband who is a software engineer(and will thankfully be tutoring me through these classes). I enjoy all things cooking and nutrition, home renovating, and reading fantasy and sci-fi novels in the little spare time that I have. I love science and am hoping to get a degree in biomedical engineering, as well as an associates in computer programming to go along with it.  

##Websites I Recommend  
[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition](https://ajcn.nutrition.org/) - This is a great database full of clincal trials and scientific studies around nutrition and health. I find the connection between nutrition and health to be fascinating!  
[Today I Found Out](https://www.todayifoundout.com/) - The website full of random and educational facts and articles you didn't know you needed.
